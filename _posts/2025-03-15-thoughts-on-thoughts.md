I apologize for that embarrassingly try-hard "deep" sounding title, but that's just what this post is. I don't mean it to sound as much like an attempt at profundity as I think I would assume the author intended if I was reading that as written by someone else. Having now  disclaimed any such intent, I do feel better about it.

Anyway, the thing that occurred to me that I wanted to write was that I feel like there are essentially two types of thoughts or ideas that I have which often manifest as written words: one which is a product of my mind's executive function and reasoning, and over which I feel ownership and responsibility (or blame), and the other is that of a more "creative" thought which feels more like a discovery of some intangible "thing" that I just happened upon, which I don't feel much in the way of ownership for (or perhaps even commitment to), and it feels more like an obligation of sorts that I must share the thing I found.  That is to say that if there are a few lines of poetry or prose that came from my hand that I happen to think are pretty great, I don't mean to say proclaim it "great" with any sort of pride or arrogance; I mean it like I'm pointing at this stumbled-upon thing and asking, "are you seeing this? Cuz I just found it here and I really like it and thought you might too." I wonder if it is even possible to say that without coming across as pompous?

I want it to come across as sincerely as one can possibly convey a fact (and, it is a bit funny that I have to acknowledge the believability of the professed sincerity grows proportionally to how much you _disagree_ with my assessment that an example of my own handiwork is "good" and thus worthy of sharing.) In any case it is true that one sort of creation feels like me having done work and the other just feels like I found someone else's product and the better that I think it is, the less likely I am to feel as if any credit for it is deserved by me.

This post, for instance feels like work: the product of knowledge and reasoning in this case *about* something I just know, that is these are thoughts about feelings. The product is probably not all that great either, but the work is my own and I am fully to blame
for any credit or disparagement due. 

So please know this: if I post something that suggests or argues some sort of reasoned thought, some opinion I hold or knowledge stemming from some original work or research that I have done, I would love to be challenged or supported with respect to the idea.  However, if it is some sort of more "creative" type endeavor: if you enjoy it, that's really awesome and is what I hoped for to justify expending some amount of effort over some period of time to create the post (or email, etc) containing or referencing it. But, if you *disagree* that there is any sort of value to having read it, well, that's cool too since I only found the words in some latent space of ideas that I don't really comprehend but just exists as do the things that inhabit it, independent of discovery.  I only saw it, thought it was cool, thought you might as well, and thought I'd point to it; credit or blame doesn't belong with me even if it seems to originate from me. 

I hope this makes a modicum of sense. The post is the construing of words born of the "effort" type, so is totally my fault.
