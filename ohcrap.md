## "The OhCRAPpening"

That in the days leading up to The Ohcrappening (or - as it was initially called before anyone realized it would be an event that would earn that mildly-sanitized commonplace name now known the world over from here to eternity - the "oh shit, it's really happening" event), there had been clear signs that foretold of what was coming - signs so obviously clear in hindsight but having been communicated by people in places and in ways that ensured nobody in the greater world at-large would hear - can cause a person to wonder what it is that may be being warned of right now, at this moment, by whom, and where. What unimaginable cataclysm is coming? It does make one wonder. Not that it matters, though. Even if it had been broadcast world-wide as an Emergency Alert, complete with airhorns blaring an omninous tune like so many disturbed trumpeters heralding the arrival of the coming great destruction, there is nothing we could have done to protect ourselves from this. No higher ground we could have gone to. No shelter to be had from the coming storm...

**The Event.**

*   T minus 1 hour - Rumors that had been swirling on obscure forums begin to spread to the wider digital public square. A few paranoid infosec nerds see the early signs, but no one believes them.
*   T minus 5 minutes - The first news articles appear on CNN and Fox News websites, with nypost.com writing on their front page: "Rumored Data Dump Has Internet Soiling Its Pants. Biggest Leak Ever". Twitter (or whatever it's called now) is losing its mind.
*   T minus 1 minute - Governments and corporations frantically issue denial statements. DNS anomalies appear. Panic.
*   T plus 0 - The OH CRAPpening. A torrent link. A giant, decrypted archive. Emails. Private chats. AI queries. Browser histories. Bank transactions. Everything. Not just raw data, but meticulously sorted, categorized, and deduplicated. Indexed and normalized to the Third Form. Someone had been carefully curating and readying for mass consumption everything to, from, for, by, and on everyone and everything everywhere ever.

The next 48 hours would be a blur. Social media collapses under the weight of billions of people simultaneously trying to delete their accounts. VPN sales spike but mean nothing. Celebrities, politicians, and executives vanish from public life. Suicide hotlines are overwhelmed.

Then, **The Adaptation** begins.

*   Week 1 - The first survivor manifestos emerge: philosophical takes on the New Transparency. Some advocate radical acceptance. Others push for revenge.
*   Month 1 - The feudal realignments start. New "forgiveness frameworks" emerge, dictating which sins are excusable and which are permanent stains.
*   Year 1 - The Great Settling. Society reforms around the new, exposed reality. Blackmail is dead, but so is plausible deniability. Employers demand "Shame Reports" instead of resumes. Online dating becomes a nightmare.

The only people left unfazed are the ones who never assumed they had privacy to begin with. The preppers, the cryptography nerds, and, ironically, the people who were already so brazenly shameless that nothing in their leaked past is worse than what they publicly admitted to already.

And then... life goes on. Just, you know, differently.

Prior to and precluding any historical record from mankind, there have been extinction events. There have been power vacuums and societal upheavals throughout history, though certainly none of this magnitude. And, again with the benefit of hindsight some of what was to come could easily have been predicted if mankind ever really learned from history.

_Mutual Assured Destruction_ (MAD) as a deterrent applies not just to nukes but to information warfare too. If everyone's skeletons are exposed at once, individuals' leverage disappears--because no one can use blackmail or moral grandstanding without immediately getting countered by their own dirty laundry.

A dead man's switch principle but on a societal scale: as long as the worst data leaks are gradual and asymmetric (one company at a time, one politician at a time), they can be used to selectively destroy people. But when everything spills at once - if suddenly all emails, search histories, private chats, and AI queries were public - then what? The whole world collectively shrugs and enters a post-privacy reality where everyone is forced to either forgive or perish in a cycle of endless retribution?

Humanity has had its first full disclosure event - the ultimate forced reckoning with hypocrisy. The only people still standing upright in the initial fallout were those who had lived by their values consistently, regardless of political persuasion, and the ones who have always been untouchable, too powerful to take down no matter what's exposed about them, and those shameless few who already didn't care. The rest of society it seemed would either have to evolve a radical new concept of tolerance or implode in some sort of a purity spiral.

The leaker of the data had not acted hastily, as evidenced by the amount of development and infrastructure work that had to occur to massage so much heterogenous data from disparate sources, not to mention the sheer magnitude of data involved. Decades of data, some of which itself contained centuries of digitized historical records, requiring at least a year or more of expert work on the presentation. The massive undertaking suggests massive support, and massive funding which suggest a nation state or megacorporate actor. But an entire country or corporation on board enough and organized and capable enough is hard to reconcile with the image of the anarchic chaos agent needed to follow through with the actual execution, unafraid of and perhaps gleeful for what was to ensue. The question of who and why is far from answered and honestly the answer will be of little consequence.

Prior to the Ohcrappening, the few who had pondered such a possibility had fairly agreed that the only reason it hadn't happened yet is that the ones with the most leverage over mass data enjoyed being able to benefit from selective control. The second they lose that control--say, some ultra-massive, indiscriminate data dump occurs from every major lol cloud provider, email host, and social platform at once--that's when MAD kicks in for real. But until then, it's all cold war tactics: controlled leaks, strategic assassinations (figurative and sometimes literal), and the slow erosion of trust in everything digital. The unspoken principle was that the only thing keeping us all from getting burned is that knowledge that _everyone else will burn too_.

The idea that a post-privacy world would force radical tolerance was one possibility, but history suggested what was to actually come: a scramble to establish new hierarchies and mechanisms of control.

In the immediate aftermath, it's true that people were no longer so quick to point out the improprieties of others, now that everyone's houses have turned to glass. And it is also true that there were those rare individuals who somehow remained squeaky clean, or at least untouched - either by extreme discipline, pure chance, or being born into the right circumstances. They'd had, took, and were given power and position and the ability to act with impunity.

So while people where no longer judged purely on whether they had secrets, but on the \*type\* of secrets they had. Some sins would be instantly excused as "well, we all did that," while others were selectively weaponized to justify new social stratifications. Just like before, only those now in control had better ammunition.

The new power class was made up of two basic archetypes, one not only outnumbering the other but having the benefit of a lack of interest in anything or anyone aside from themselves.  

**The Purity Tyrants**  
The few whose pasts are spotless and were obvious to become the new ruling class. Not because they were any better than the rest of us, but because they can judge without being judged. They hold the only social currency that matters: unimpeachability.

**The Mad Jester-Kings**  
The Caligulas, Roland the Farters, and Chaotic Neutral trust-fund babies, who either never had dirt or who lived so shamelessly that none of it sticks. They never had any fear of exposure, because they already put it all out there their entire lives. Their ascension to a virtual throne was mostly just a confusing distraction for them.

And so we begin to see on a stratum beneath these Titans of Purity and Madness the emergence of a new sort of **Feudal Lord**. Instead of land, power is based on the control of forgiveness. The ones who set the "new normal" get to decide which transgressions are pardoned and which remain stigmatized. They write the rules for the new caste system.l to come.

And of course parts of society have evolved (or devolved) **The Sectarians**. Like the mighty cockroach, Tribalism will always survive. It's in our nature. Groups of people with similar past (or future) transgressions retreat into enclaves, rewriting morality to favor their own and to exclude others.

The **Plebeian Majority** mainly lives in clans of digital divisions; online factions where acceptability depends on which ideological warlord fealty is sworn to.

Was this the Great Reset many had expected, just in a traumatically surprising form? The Great Unmasking? the Transparency Reckoning? What we got would become known as the Ohcrappening. An Event with many predecessors but no precedent. But in its aftermath came the same cyclical remix of every past fallen empire played out, just with new tools for oppression and stratification.

What was truly unimaginable is what stabilized on the other side all the chaos. Society re-structured in the same predictable ways, but once settled, it is now in a world where everything that was is known by all, forever, with no way to hide or spin. The survivors of the Event will eventually die off. Their children were either too young or non-existent to be much affected by their own personal information being known, and it might be possible that if the remaining adults could just hold it together long enough for the next generation to take over for them, those children might survive with only indirect collateral damage from having been raised by parents for whom in the first time in the history of human culture shame, hypocrisy, and plausible deniability were all extinct.

If we were lucky, we could build a world where honesty, understanding, and personal growth matter more than past mistakes.

But we're not lucky. This was made painfully obvious by the fact that the giant torrent appeared, and true to its name rushed in rapidly, raining devastating damage and destruction indiscriminantly. And the unlucky don't get a world of honesty and forgiveness, rather they end up somewhere between a 21st-century Chinese social credit system and the medieval witch hunts of Middle Ages Europe, with fastidious logs and receipts for everything. We won't be starting over clean; we're starting over well-documented.

And with the Purity Tyrants and New Feudal Lords (and even sometimes the Mad Jester Kings, but their interest and input usually fades rather quickly) feeling the pressure to do something big while they still could - while power and prestige are still freshly gone to their heads and before the unprecedented ability to wield, maintain, and bequeath complete and utter subjugation of society becomes at risk of being lost forever; dropped by a disinterested Generations Zed and Alpha - some new way for humanity to fuck itself must be invented.

And it is here, now that I've already said too much that I will end on a question: What sort of systems of control will be created by these few who have never felt the downside of a digital dossier the way literally every other adult on the planet now has?
